Its primary purpose is to gain insights, make informed decisions, and draw conclusions from data by using various techniques and methods.

        "Nominal Data: Nominal data consists of categories or labels that represent different groups or classes. These categories have no inherent order or ranking. Nominal data only provides information about the distinct categories or groups to which items or individuals belong. For example, in nominal data, you can categorize items into different classes, but you cannot say that one class is higher or better than another.\n",

        "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data also consists of categories or labels, but in this case, the categories have a meaningful order or ranking.

Whiskers show the full extent of the data distribution, allowing you to see how far the data reaches in both directions.\n",

        "Outliers: Individual data points that fall outside the whiskers are often displayed as individual points or small dots, indicating potential outliers in the data.\n",

        "A box plot provides a clear visual representation of the range of data values, including the central tendency (IQR), the minimum and maximum values (whiskers), and any potential outliers.

        "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Mean (Average):\n",
        "\n",
        "Description:\n",
        "The mean is the arithmetic average of a dataset. It's calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of data points.\n",
        "Use: The mean provides a measure of the typical or central value in a dataset. It's sensitive to outliers and extreme values, so it may not be the best measure if the data has significant outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Median:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data is ordered from lowest to highest. If there is an even number of data points, it's the average of the two middle values.\n",
        "Use: The median is robust to outliers, making it a good measure of central tendency when the data contains extreme values. It represents the value that separates the lower and upper halves of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mode:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.\n",
        "Use: The mode is especially useful for categorical data and bimodal or multimodal distributions. It indicates the most common category or value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Measures of Variability:\n",
        "\n",
        "Range:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
        "Use: The range provides a simple measure of the spread or dispersion of data. However, it\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: Variance measures how individual data points deviate from the mean. It's calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
        "Use: Variance quantifies the spread of data, with higher values indicating greater dispersion. It's commonly used in statistical calculations, but it's in squared units, so the standard deviation is often preferred for interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standard Deviation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average distance between data points and the mean.\n",
        "Use: The standard deviation provides a more interpretable measure of variability than the variance because it is in the same units as the data. A smaller standard deviation indicates less spread, while a larger standard deviation indicates more spread.\n",
        "Interquartile Range (IQR):\n",
        "\n",
        "Description: The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data. It represents the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "Use: The IQR is a robust measure of spread that is not affected by extreme values. It helps describe the central range of the data and identify potential outliers."
